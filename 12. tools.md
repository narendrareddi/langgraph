# Detailed Notes on Adding Tools to Chatbot in LangGraph

## Fundamentals: Adding Tools in LangGraph
- Basic Workflow: User query → Chat node (LLM) → Response.
- Modifications for Tools:
  - **Chat Node Upgrade**: Decides chat vs. action (tool call).
  - **Tool Node**: Pre-built node bridging graph and external tools; holds tool collection.
    - Handles tool calls: Routes to correct tool, executes, returns results.
  - **Tools Condition**: Built-in conditional edge; from chat node, routes to tools (if needed) or end.
- Updated Flow:
  - Query → Chat node (decides via tools_condition).
  - If chat: → End (response).
  - If action: → Tool node → Back to chat node (refine output) → End.
  - Loop between chat and tool nodes enables multi-step tool chaining.
- Key Concepts:
  - Tool Types: Pre-built (e.g., DuckDuckGo) or custom (e.g., calculator via @tool decorator).
  - Bind Tools: Attach tools to LLM for decision-making.
  - State: Messages list for context.
  - Graph: Add nodes (chat, tool), edges (start → chat; conditional from chat; tool → chat).
