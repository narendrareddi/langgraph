# Notes on Generative AI vs Agentic AI


## What is Generative AI?
- **Definition**: A class of AI models that create new content (text, images, audio, code, video) resembling human-created data.
  - Branch of AI focused on generating new data in various modalities (textual, visual, etc.).
  - Output feels human-like.

- **Examples of Successful Products**:
  - **Text Generation (LLMs)**: ChatGPT (replaced Google for many), Gemini, Claude, Grok – intelligent chatbots generating human-like text.
  - **Image Generation**: DALL-E, Midjourney – generate images from text descriptions.
  - **Code Generation**: Code Llama – fine-tuned LLMs for writing software code.
  - **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: ElevenLabs – converts text to realistic human-like speech.
  - **Video Generation**: Sora – generates short video clips from text descriptions.
- **Journey**: Started with ChatGPT ~3 years ago; products have been successful in their domains.

## Generative AI vs Traditional AI
- **Traditional AI (Classical ML/Deep Learning)**:
  - Focus: Identify patterns/relationships between inputs and outputs from data.
  - Examples:
    - Classification: Spam email detection, cancer diagnosis from X-rays.
    - Regression: Predict continuous values like temperature or stock prices.
  - Process: Study data, find patterns, predict outputs for new inputs.
- **Generative AI**:
  - Focus: Learn the data distribution (nature/fit of data) to generate new samples.
  - Example: Train on cat images → Understand how real cats look → Generate new cat images.
  - Fundamental Difference: Traditional AI predicts based on input-output relations; Gen AI generates new data mimicking the original distribution.
  - Key Strength: Outputs are refined and human-like, enabling applications across domains.
- Gen AI is constantly evolving (e.g., early image models had spelling errors; now improved).

## Applications of Generative AI
- **Creative and Business Writing**: Generate blogs, emails; integrate into tools like Gmail for summaries/replies.
- **Software Development**: Auto-complete code, debug errors (e.g., via ChatGPT instead of Stack Overflow).
- **Customer Support**: AI chatbots handle queries; escalate to humans if needed (e.g., Ola, Uber, Zomato use them).
- **Education**: Clear doubts from videos, create personalized curricula, simplify topics.
- **Design**: Generate thumbnails, infographics, ads/videos (e.g., using Midjourney, Sora, Runway).
- **Overall**: Mimics human creativity; adopted across industries; will integrate into most apps.

## Practical Scenario: Hiring a Backend Engineer as HR Recruiter
- Task Breakdown:
  1. Draft Job Description (JD).
  2. Post JD on job portals (e.g., Naukri.com).
  3. Shortlist candidates from applications (e.g., top 25 from 1000 resumes).
  4. Schedule and conduct interviews.
  5. Roll out offer letter.
  6. Onboard the selected candidate.

## Solving with Generative AI (Simple LLM-Based Chatbot)
- Company provides a basic chatbot for assistance.
- **Execution**:
  - Draft JD: Chatbot generates based on requirements.
  - Post JD: Chatbot suggests platforms (e.g., LinkedIn, Naukri); user posts manually.
  - Shortlist: Chatbot gives generic advice; user reviews resumes manually.
  - Schedule Interviews: Chatbot drafts email; user sends.
  - Interview: Chatbot generates question bank; user conducts.
  - Offer Letter: Chatbot drafts; user sends.
- **Benefits**: Assists in content generation; reduces manual effort compared to pre-Gen AI era.
- **Problems**:
  - Reactive: User initiates every step.
  - No Memory: Forgets context (e.g., previous JD).
  - Generic Advice: Not company-specific.
  - No Actions: Can't post JD or send emails itself.

## Improvement 1: RAG-Based Chatbot (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- Connect chatbot to company knowledge base (documents like past JDs, hiring playbook, salary bands, interview questions, onboarding templates).
- **Execution** (Same Task):
  - JD: Tailored to company (e.g., tech stack like Python/Django, salary based on experience).
  - Post JD: Suggests best platforms from past data; user posts manually.
  - Shortlist: Company-specific pointers; analyzes resumes if uploaded.
  - Schedule: Uses company email templates.
  - Interview: Pulls past questions.
  - Offer: Company-format letter.
- **Improvement**: Specific, tailored advice.
- **Remaining Problems**: Still reactive, no memory, no actions.

## Improvement 2: Tool-Augmented Chatbot
- Integrate tools/APIs: LinkedIn, resume parser, calendar, email, HR management software.
- **Execution** (Same Task):
  - JD: As before.
  - Post JD: Automatically posts via APIs.
  - Monitor Applications: Checks via APIs; suggests adjustments (e.g., broaden JD, boost post).
  - Shortlist: Downloads/parses resumes, ranks candidates.
  - Schedule: Checks calendar, sends invites.
  - Interview: As before.
  - Offer/Onboard: Sends letter, triggers onboarding (e.g., contract, email ID, laptop).
- **Improvement**: Takes actions autonomously.
- **Remaining Problems**: Reactive, no memory/context awareness, no adaptation (user must point out issues).

## Final Improvement: Agentic AI Chatbot
- Makes chatbot proactive, context-aware (memory), adaptable.
- **Key Features**:
  - Understands goal (e.g., hire backend engineer).
  - Plans steps autonomously.
  - Executes with tools; monitors and adapts (e.g., if few applications, suggest/re-execute fixes).
  - Keeps human in loop for approvals.
- **Execution** (Same Task):
  - Drafts/reviews JD.
  - Posts/monitors via APIs; adapts if low applications (e.g., revise JD, boost).
  - Screens/shortlists automatically.
  - Schedules via calendar/email.
  - Reminds for interviews; provides questions.
  - Sends offer; triggers onboarding upon acceptance.
- **Improvements**: Proactive (plans/executes), memory (tracks progress), adaptable (identifies/fixes issues).
- Result: High autonomy; recruiter monitors/approves only.

## Conclusion: Key Differences
- **Generative AI**: Focuses on content creation; reactive; human-guided.
- **Agentic AI**: Achieves goals autonomously; proactive; plans, executes, adapts.
  - Uses Gen AI (e.g., LLMs for reasoning) as a building block.
  - Broader: Includes tools, planning, memory.
- Gen AI is a capability; Agentic AI is a behavior using multiple capabilities.
- Evolution: From Gen AI (content) to Agentic AI (goal-oriented autonomy).
