# Notes on What is Agentic AI? 

## Definition of Agentic AI
- **Formal Definition**: Agentic AI is a type of AI that can take a task and goal from a user and work towards completing it on its own with minimal human guidance. It plans, takes actions, adapts to changes, and seeks help only when necessary.
- **Simple Explanation**: A software paradigm where you provide a goal, and the system autonomously plans and executes to achieve it, with minimal human involvement.
- **Contrast with Other Paradigms**: Unlike reactive systems (e.g., Generative AI chatbots like ChatGPT, which respond only to specific queries).
  - **Example: Travel to Goa**
    - Generative AI (Reactive): User asks step-by-step (e.g., best travel mode, hotels, itinerary); chatbot responds per query.
    - Agentic AI (Proactive/Autonomous): User states goal (e.g., travel dates); system plans and executes everything (travel, hotels, itinerary) autonomously.

## Key Characteristics of Agentic AI Systems
- Six main traits to identify if a system (e.g., chatbot) is Agentic AI.
- **1. Autonomous**:
  - Ability to make decisions and take actions independently to achieve goals without step-by-step human instructions.
  - Proactive (acts before prompted) vs. reactive (e.g., Gen AI).
  - Types: Execution autonomy (runs steps), decision-making (e.g., shortlisting), tool usage.
  - Control Mechanisms: Limit tools/actions, human-in-the-loop checkpoints, override commands, guardrails/policies.
  - Risks if Uncontrolled: Incorrect offers, biases in hiring, excessive spending.
- **2. Goal-Oriented**:
  - Operates with a persistent objective; directs all actions toward it, not isolated responses.
  - Goals act as a "compass" for autonomy.
  - Can include constraints (e.g., remote only, budget limit).
  - Stored in memory (e.g., JSON: goal, constraints, status, progress).
  - Can be altered mid-way (e.g., switch to freelancer if no applicants).
- **3. Planning**:
  - Breaks high-level goals into structured sequences of actions/subgoals.
  - Iterative process: Planning → Execution loop until goal achieved.
  - Three Steps:
    1. Generate multiple candidate plans (treat as search problem from initial to final state).
    2. Evaluate plans (criteria: efficiency, tool availability, cost, risk, alignment with constraints).
    3. Select best plan (via human input, policy, or auto).
- **4. Reasoning**:
  - Cognitive process to interpret information, draw conclusions, and make decisions during planning and execution.
  - Needed in Planning: Goal decomposition, tool selection, resource estimation.
  - Needed in Execution: Decision-making (e.g., interview count), human-in-the-loop (when to seek help), error handling (e.g., retry if API down).
  - Example: Human analogy – phone stolen → interpret → conclude risks → decide to block number.
- **5. Adaptable**:
  - Modifies plans/strategies/actions in response to unexpected conditions while staying goal-aligned.
  - Reasons to Adapt: Failures (e.g., tool down), external feedback (e.g., low applications), goal changes.
  - Environment: Context where agent operates (e.g., job portals, applicants for recruiter).
- **6. Context-Aware**:
  - Understands, retains, and utilizes relevant info from ongoing tasks, past interactions, user preferences, and environment.
  - Types of Context: Original goal, progress/interactions, environment state, tool responses, user preferences, policies/guardrails.
  - Implemented via Memory: Short-term (current session) vs. Long-term (persistent across sessions).

## Core Components of Agentic AI Systems
- Five high-level components (focus on LLM-based systems).
- **1. Brain (LLM)**:
  - Core: Interprets goals, plans, reasons, selects tools, handles natural language communication.
  - Heavy lifting: Goal interpretation, planning/reasoning, tool selection, user interaction.
- **2. Orchestrator**:
  - Executes the plan step-by-step; like a project manager.
  - Tasks: Task sequencing, conditional routing (if-then), retry logic, looping/iteration, delegation (to human/LLM).
  - Built using frameworks (e.g., LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen).
- **3. Tools**:
  - Enables interaction with external world (e.g., APIs for posting jobs, resume parsers, email/calendar).
  - Like "hands and legs"; includes knowledge bases (e.g., RAG for company docs).
- **4. Memory**:
  - Stores context: Short-term (current session: messages, tool calls) vs. Long-term (goals, past interactions, preferences).
  - Tracks state/progress.
- **5. Supervisor**:
  - Handles human-in-the-loop: Approvals for high-risk actions, enforces guardrails, escalates edge cases.
  - Ensures collaboration between agent and human.
